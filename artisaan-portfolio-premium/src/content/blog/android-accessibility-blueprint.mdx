Accessibility is a mindset, not a checklist. We embed inclusive design from planning to production.

### Inclusive discovery

We run structured interviews with voice assistant users, low-vision testers, and neurodiverse participants. Insights shape the backlog before we design a single screen.

### Engineering guardrails

- Compose semantics ensure every component exposes meaningful labels and state.
- Dynamic type scales gracefully with custom typography tokens.
- Color contrast lives in our design tokens, validated via automated tests.

```kotlin
Modifier.semantics {
    contentDescription = "Play soundscape"
    role = Role.Button
}
```

### Testing rigor

Every release includes automated accessibility checks in Espresso, manual TalkBack runs, and color-blindness simulations. The result: a portfolio that scores 100% on internal a11y audits.
