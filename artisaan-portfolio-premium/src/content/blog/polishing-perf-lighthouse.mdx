When we rebuilt Artisaan.com we set a non-negotiable goal: 95+ Lighthouse on mobile and desktop. Achieving that score required a holistic approach.

### 1. Smart bundling

We embraced the App Router to split sections into server components. Heavy animation libraries such as Framer Motion load only where interactions demand them. Analytics scripts stay deferred until consent is captured.

### 2. Image pipeline

We leaned on Next.js remote patterns to source Unsplash imagery and applied blur placeholders. Every hero asset compresses to WebP at runtime and is constrained to responsive breakpoints.

### 3. Edge caching

Static segments cache aggressively via ISR, while dynamic sections revalidate hourly. We layered in a service worker with `next-pwa` for offline access to support docs and changelogs.

```tsx
export const revalidate = 3600;

export default async function HomePage() {
  const [featuredApps, posts] = await Promise.all([
    getFeaturedApps(),
    getAllBlogPosts(),
  ]);
  // Render
}
```

### 4. Continuous monitoring

We hooked up automated Playwright smoke tests and Lighthouse CI budgets. Every pull request must hit our targets before merging.
