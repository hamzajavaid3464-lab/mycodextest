<Callout type="tip" title="Start with intent">
Motion is not decorationâ€”it is a language. Define the vocabulary before you animate a single pixel.
</Callout>

### Why motion matters

Motion bridges intent and interaction. In Artisaan Notes, we orchestrated transitions so every element reinforces hierarchy. The floating action button blooms into a full-screen composer; cards fold with depth; success states pulse softly. These micro-gestures boost comprehension by 17% in our usability sessions.

### Building a motion system

We established a motion spec anchored in three principles:

1. **Meaningful timing.** Ease-out curves for arrivals, ease-in for departures, and a default duration of 180ms.
2. **Spatial continuity.** Elements travel along logical paths that mirror user intent.
3. **Tactile feedback.** Haptics and audio cues reinforce the visual language.

```kotlin
val kineticTiming = Easing.bezier(0.2f, 0.8f, 0.2f, 1.0f)
animatedVisibility(
    visible = isExpanded,
    enter = fadeIn(animationSpec = tween(180, easing = kineticTiming)) +
        scaleIn(initialScale = 0.92f),
    exit = fadeOut(animationSpec = tween(120, easing = kineticTiming))
) {
    // Content
}
```

### Measuring the impact

We launched the motion system in Focus Suite 3.5 and benchmarked performance. Compose profiling confirmed no dropped frames on flagship devices, and even mid-tier phones maintained 58-60fps. The result: a 12% uplift in session length and rave reviews calling the experience "alive".

<Callout type="note" title="Rollout playbook">
Ship motion iteratively. Roll to beta first, collect ANR/crash telemetry, and capture user delight scores before GA.
